She is also a very successful model, who has worked for such brands as Chanel, Rag & Bone, and Calvin Klein.</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=selah-marley-age></span><span>Selah Marley Age</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Selah was born on November 12, 1999, in the United States. She is currently 20 years old as of 2019.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=selah-marley-height></span><span>Selah Marley Height</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Selah stands at an average height of 5 feet and 3 inches.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=selah-marley-family-and-education></span><span>Selah Marley Family and Education</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Selah is the spitting image of her mother, Grammy Award-winning rapper and singer <strong>Lauryn Hill</strong>. Her father is <strong>Rohan Marley</strong>, the sixth child born to reggae legend <strong>Bob Marley</strong> and <strong>Janet Hunt</strong>. Although Selah’s parents are no longer together (they share a total of five children), both remain extremely close to their daughter. Although she’s barely out of high school, Selah has spoken time and time again about her desire to model from a young age.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=selah-marley-mother></span><span>Selah Marley Mother</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Her mother is famous American singer and rapper Lauryn Hill. Her mother is known for being a member of <strong>Fugees</strong> and for her solo album <strong>The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill</strong>, which won many awards and broke several sales records.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=selah-marley-dad></span><span>Selah Marley Dad</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Her dad’s name is Rohan Marley. <strong>Rohan Anthony Marley</strong> is a Jamaican entrepreneur and former gridiron football player. He is the son of reggae artist Bob Marley and Janet Hunt.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=selah-marley-model></span><span>Selah Marley Model</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Walking a Chanel show, posing in a Calvin Klein ad, and being a part of Kanye West’s Yeezy lineup would be major accomplishments for any model, but for Selah Marley, the daughter of music legend Lauryn Hill, the achievements are just the beginning. At just 5 feet 3 inches tall, Marley is defying old notions about what petite models can and can’t do, racking up covers and campaigns in quick succession.</p><p>It only takes a moment with her on the set of Vogue.com’s New York collections video to see that the 18-year-old radiates confidence and nonchalant cool. In between poses, she talked about what it’s like to go from high school to the glamorous world of modeling, and why she still looks to Mom when it comes to fashion advice.</p><p>She’s known she wanted to model since she was a kid.“I was like 11, in sixth grade, and I lived with my dad, so he was staying at the Gansevoort, near Times Square, and I just told him, ‘Daddy, I want to model.’ He was with his girlfriend at the time, who was a model. He said. ‘All right, do the catwalk.’ So I did a little two-step for them!”</p><p>This season she got her first taste of life in the front row.“This year I’ve actually been attending a lot of shows. I attended Coach, Michael Kors, Marc Jacobs, and that was dope. I got to do a lot of photo ops and it was a new experience for me because I would walk out and there were paparazzi taking pictures of me. It was cool but definitely new to me.”</p><p>Walking for Yeezy Season 5 was the highlight of her New York Fashion Week.“Most of my experience has been doing shoots, so doing Yeezy this season was really awesome. I’m glad that I got that chance; the clothes were amazing. Fashion Week was a little hectic for me, but I’m sure not as bad as models who are doing three shows a day or anything like that.”</p><p>Her personal style depends on her mood.“It all depends on how I feel in the morning, so sometimes I’m feeling tomboyish, but I love mixing tomboy with sexy. I’ll wear huge baggy cargo pants and a bikini top or a tank top. I know everyone hates skinny jeans now, but I love them! Sometimes I’ll just wear them with combat boots, or military boots. I love doing a hoodie under a jean jacket, for example, or under a leather jacket.”</p><p>Her mom is her biggest fashion influence, but Rihanna is pretty cool, too.“I think my mom for one is incredibly fashionable. She’s the one who exposed me to the fashion world simply because of everything that she has. Our basement is literally like a museum of couture! It’s insane. I can go shopping down there, and I do. I also love Rihanna. I think she’s dope. I love the way she dresses up. I have a million screenshots of her in my phone. If I had to give it to anyone, I’d give it to those two people.”</p><p>Working with music icons including Beyoncé for Ivy Park and Kanye West on Yeezy is a special treat.“I’m very honored that these huge icons have chosen me. I feel great that these people who I respect so much admire me and my style.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=selah-marley-facts-and-body-measurements></span><span>Selah Marley Facts and Body Measurements</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong>Full Name:&nbsp;</strong>Serah Louise Marley</li><li><strong>Age/ How Old?:&nbsp;</strong>20</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:&nbsp;</strong>November 12, 1999</li><li><strong>Place of Birth:&nbsp;</strong>USA</li><li><strong>Education‎:&nbsp;</strong>Not Available</li><li><strong>Birthday:&nbsp;</strong>November 12</li><li><strong>Nationality:&nbsp;</strong>American</li><li><strong>Father’s Name:&nbsp;</strong>Rohan Marley</li><li><strong>Mother’s Name:&nbsp;</strong>Lauryn Hill</li><li><strong>Siblings:&nbsp;</strong>4</li><li><strong>Married?:&nbsp;</strong>Not Married</li><li><strong>Children/ Kids:&nbsp;</strong>Not Available</li><li><strong>Height/ How tall?:&nbsp;</strong>5 feet 3 inches</li><li><strong>Weight:&nbsp;</strong>Not Available</li><li><strong>Profession</strong>:&nbsp;Model and Singer</li><li><strong>Net worth</strong>: Not Available</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=selah-marley-net-worth></span><span>Selah Marley Net Worth</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite his obvious riches, She prefers to lead a modest lifestyle.

The NJ-born model and singer has released her first single, “Breathe” in 2017.</p><p>Marley teamed up with Kyle Provencio Reignold (KPR) to produce and co-wrote the song with Brooklyn-Based rapper IDKHIM aka Chuma Osse. The trio of songwriters met while they were attending New York University with the song recorded in one of their dorm rooms. She went on to credit Hill with providing her with great advice and guidance. “My mom has been a guiding light,” explained Marley. “In the sense of creativity, she always told me not to rush. She always told me to take my time.”</p><h1><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Selah Marley</span></h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-selah-marley></span><span>Who is Selah Marley?&nbsp;</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Selah is the daughter of American musician and entertainer, Lauryn Hill and the former football player, Rohan Marley, as well as the granddaughter of the reggae superstar, Bob Marley.
